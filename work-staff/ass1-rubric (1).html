<h3>comp20005 Assignment 1 Marking Rubric</h3>

<p>
<p>
Marks will not go below zero in each section.
The overall mark is the sum of the three section marks.

<h4>Section 1: Program Presentation</h4>

This section of the rubric covers:
layout and style, readability, adherence to coding
expectations, general care and appearance.
<p>
All submissions will be awarded the following starting mark:
<p><ul>

<li>Stages 1 to 3 initial allocation, +5.
<!-- BEGIN-CHOICES
<li>Stage 2 initial allocation, +0.
<li>Stage 3 initial allocation, +0.
<li>Stage 4 initial allocation, +0.
END-CHOICES -->

</ul><p>
<i>Section 1 Deductions</i>
<p>
Some subset of the following lines will be retained by the marker,
to provide feedback on your program.
Some deductions may be applied more than once.
Marks in each of the three sections of the rubric won't go below zero.
<p><ul>

<li>#defines not in upper case, -0.5;
<li>absence of function prototypes, -0.5;
<li>bad choice for function names, -0.5;
<li>bad choices for variable names, -0.5;
<li>excessive commenting, -0.5;
<li>insufficient commenting, -0.5;
<li>inconsistent bracket placement, -0.5;
<li>inconsistent indentation, -0.5;
<li>lack of whitespace (visual appeal), -0.5;
<li>lines &gt;80 chars, -0.5;
<li>use of magic numbers, -0.5;
<li>unhelpful #defines, -0.5;
<li>use of constant subscripts in 2d arrays, -1.0;
<li>other stylistic issue (minor), -0.5;
<li>other stylistic issue (major), -1.0;
<li>empty program, or helloworld, or etc, -5.0;
<!-- BEGIN-CHOICES
END-CHOICES -->

</ul><p>
<i>Bonus additions (these will be included in your total mark only if
they are required to offset marks lost within this first section of the
rubric)</i>
<p><ul>
 
<li>comment at end of source code that says "programming is fun", +0.5;
<li>overall care and presentation, +0.5;
<!-- BEGIN-CHOICES
END-CHOICES -->

</ul>


<h4>Section 2: Structure and Approach</h4>

This section of the rubric covers: decomposition into functions,
development of data structures and declaration of them at the
appropriate locations, choice of parameters to functions,
<!--use of appropriate <tt>struct</tt> and
<tt>typedef</tt> declarations, choice of algorithms or methods,
-->
overall flow and high-level readability.
<p>
Some subset of the following lines will be retained by the marker,
matching how far you got through the assignment's stages.
<p><ul>

<li>Stage 1 initial allocation, +2.
<li>Stage 2 initial allocation, +4.
<li>Stage 3 initial allocation, +0.
<!-- BEGIN-CHOICES
END-CHOICES -->

</ul><p>
<i>Section 2 Deductions</i>
<p>
Some subset of the following lines will be retained by the marker, to provide feedback on your program.
Some deductions may be applied more than once.
Marks in each section won't go below zero.
<p><ul>

<li>duplicate code segments, -0.5;
<li>main program too long or too complex, -1.0;
<li>other functions too long or too complex, -0.5;
<li>global variables, -1.0;
<li>insufficient use of functions, -0.5;
<li>overly complex algorithmic approach, -0.5;
<li>unnecessary duplication/copying of data, -0.5;
<li>overly complex function argument lists, -0.5;
<li>other structural issue (minor), -0.5;
<li>other structural issue (major), -1.0;
<!-- BEGIN-CHOICES
END-CHOICES -->

</ul>

<!-- Replace this line if you wish to add comments -->

<h4>Section 3: Program execution</h4>
This section of the rubric covers: compilation, execution on test
data, output presentation and readability.
Programs that do not compile in the test environment will lose substantial
marks.
Be sure to check that your submission compiled and executed
after you have submitted it.
Don't say "finished" until you truly are!
<p>
Some subset of the following additions will be retained by the marker.
<p><ul>

<li>Stage 1 initial allocation, +1.
<li>Stage 2 initial allocation, +4.
<li>Stage 3 initial allocation, +4.
<!-- BEGIN-CHOICES
END-CHOICES -->

</ul><p>
<i>Section 3 Deductions</i>
<p>Some subset of the following deductions will be retained by the marker.
Marks in each section won't go below zero.
<p><ul>

<li>failure to compile, -4.0;
<li>unnecessary warning messages in compilation, -1.0;

<li>incorrect Stage 1 layout or values in any test, -0.5 or -1.0 or -1.5;
<li>incorrect Stage 2 layout or values in any test, -0.5 or -1.0 or -1.5;
<li>incorrect Stage 3 layout or values in any test, -0.5 or -1.0 or -1.5;

<!-- BEGIN-CHOICES
END-CHOICES -->

</ul><p>
<p>
<h4>Deductions: Late Submission</h4>
If you make a late submission without having prior agreement from
Alistair, one of these lines might also be retained.
Overall marks won't go below zero.
"Days late" includes weekend days.
<p><ul>
<li>one day late, -2.0;
<li>two days late, -4.0;
<li>three days late, -6.0;
<li>four days late, -8.0;
<li>five to seven days late, -10.0;
</ul>
No submissions will be accepted more than seven days after the
deadline, and no extensions of more than seven days will be
granted.<p> 

<p>
<h4>Deductions: Academic Honesty Compliance</h4>
The following deductions will be applied to your overall mark if necessary.
Overall marks won't go below zero.
<p><ul>
<li>missing Authorship Declaration at top of program, -5.0;
<li>incomplete or unsigned Authorship Declaration at top of program, -3.0;
<li>use of external code without attribution (minor), -2.0;
<li>use of external code without attribution (major), -10.0;
<li>significant overlap detected with another student's submission, -10.0;
<!-- BEGIN-CHOICES
END-CHOICES -->
</ul><p>

<h4>Overall Mark</h4>

<p>Your overall mark will be determined by:
<ul>
<li>Computing a mark for "Program Presentation", taking into account
the "stage" your program reaches, and including (if you had any
deductions) the "bonus" marks.
Your mark in this section will not go below zero and will not go above five.
<li>Computing a mark for "Structure and Approach", taking into
account the "stage" your program reaches.
Your mark in this section will not go below zero.
<li>Computing a mark for "Program Execution", taking into
account the "stage" your program reaches.
Your mark in this section will not go below zero.
<li>Adding those three component marks.
<li> Subtracting off any Late Penalty that applies.
<li> Subtracting off any Academic Honesty deduction that applies.
<li>If the result is below zero, setting the mark to zero.
</ul>
